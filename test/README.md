## 1. Introduction
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations play a crucial role in understanding and optimizing **crystal growth** processes in various industries, including semiconductor manufacturing and materials science. Traditional CFD approaches based on numerical solvers (e.g., finite element, finite volume, and finite difference methods) are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in **Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO)**, **FigConVNet**, and NVIDIA Modulus offer opportunities to significantly accelerate these simulations while maintaining accuracy.
