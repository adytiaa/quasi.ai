Idea: Development of Real time digital twins by accelerating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations for crystal growth (Silicon Single Crystal) with Physics-inspired geometry aware classical and hybrid quantum-classical approaches 


The Problem: The growth of high-quality silicon single crystals—critical for semiconductors, optics, and advanced materials—relies on processes like Czochralski and Bridgman methods, driven by complex, multiscale fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and phase-change phenomena. Accurate modeling requires high-fidelity CFD simulations, but these are computationally prohibitive, often taking days or weeks on HPC systems. This latency prevents real-time monitoring, control, and optimization, forcing manufacturers to rely on costly, empirical trial-and-error approaches.
Current solutions fail due to:
    • Speed – Simulations are too slow for in-situ decision-making.
    • Fidelity – Reduced-order models compromise physical accuracy.
    • Generality – Models lack adaptability to different geometries and materials.
This challenge persists because research academia focuses on narrow physics, startups avoid high-risk quantum-classical approaches, and big tech prioritizes generic platforms over domain-specific innovation. The integration of domain-driven physics, heterogeneous computing, and hybrid AI–quantum models remains an untapped opportunity for transformative real-time digital twins in crystal growth.

High-Impact Innovation Program: Development of real-time digital twin for silicon single-crystal growth by fusing quantum computing, AI, and physics-based modeling.
Core Components:
    • Hybrid Quantum–Classical Backends: Heterogeneous HPC–QC systems (e.g., NVIDIA DGX Quantum, QPU–CPU–GPU stacks) running classical CFD solvers alongside quantum-accelerated modules for pressure solves, optimization, and inverse problems.
    • Physics-Informed, Geometry-Aware AI: Surrogates such as PI-GANO and GAOT integrate Navier–Stokes, heat transfer, and solidification kinetics with mesh-aware graph neural operators for accurate, generalizable flow–thermal predictions.
    • Quantum-Accelerated Solvers: Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS), VQE, and variational time-stepping methods for PDEs, coupled with Hamiltonian encodings, to speed up sparse linear solves and nonlinear PDE dynamics relevant to melt flow and phase change.
    • Inverse Control & Optimization: Quantum optimization loops adjust process parameters (e.g., pull rate, rotation speed, thermal gradient) in real time to minimize defects and maintain target crystal shapes.
Platform Architecture:
    1. Hybrid Simulation Backend – GPU-based CFD for geometry and streaming flow; QPU-accelerated routines for linear solves and optimization.
    2. Surrogate Modeling Layer – PI-GANO/GAOT modules trained on multiphysics CFD data for orders-of-magnitude faster inference.
    3. Quantum-Accelerated Control – VQA-based loops for parameter tuning and steady-state target tracking.
    4. Multi-Modal Data Integration – Real-time sensor fusion with adaptive surrogate retraining to handle drift and geometry variation.









Innovations:
    • Physics-informed loss functions embedding PDE residuals directly into training (PINNs, GN-PINNs, RF-PINNs, PI-GANO, GAOT).
    • Geometry-aware mesh graph encodings with node features like curvature, local gradients, and resolution.
    • Quantum iterative PDE solvers (Jacobi/Gauss–Seidel, HHL-based) for CFD subproblems.
    • Transferable architecture applicable to multiple crystal growth processes.
      
What needs to become possible?
    1. Ultra-fast, high-fidelity simulation of 3D, non-linear, multiphase CFD systems in real-world reactor geometries.
    2. Model generalization across materials, scales, and reactor designs with minimal retraining.
    3. Differentiable, inverse-model capabilities for real-time process control, optimization, and AI co-design of reactors.
Path to prototype
    • Develop and validate a hybrid physics-based AI surrogate for 2D crystal growth (e.g., simplified Czochralski) with quantum modules for sparse linear solvers. 
    • Integrate hybrid quantum-classical solvers into the HPC stack. Scale to 3D geometries Build a simulation-as-a-service layer that supports real-time data ingestion and feedback
    • Validation across different semi conducting materials (GaN, SiC, Si, Perovskites).
    • Demonstrate closed-loop control in a physical lab reactor via the digital twin, achieving >10x reduction in modeling time and increased process efficiency. 
Why now?
    • Quantum-classical hardware integration is emerging, notably NVIDIA DGX Quantum and IonQ’s quantum networking stack.
    • Neural operators and physics-aware GNNs have reached maturity and demonstrated orders-of-magnitude speedups in surrogate modeling.
    • Materials science is bottlenecked by compute-bound simulation—and global demand for semiconductors and clean energy devices is skyrocketing.
Societal, economic, and geopolitical pressures are aligning around sovereign materials infrastructure—real-time digital twins are a critical enabler.

It requires access to quantum hardware (QPU time), HPC infrastructure, and test-bed crystal growth reactors, alongside deep collaboration with academic labs, quantum platform providers (e.g., NVIDIA, Rigetti, IQM), and materials manufacturers.
